Bridge to the GRIM_Revised_2 viewer/dataset tool (``grim_dataset.RcsGrid``).

Both projects read and write ``.grim`` (npz) files and they ARE compatible --
RcsGrid.load reads every file this repo writes, and phase agrees to float32.
There is exactly one thing to know before mixing them:

    rcs_power is the PHYSICAL quantity in both tools, but this repo's
    rcs_amp_real/imag is the SOLVER'S FIELD amplitude, which is NOT
    sqrt(rcs_power).  There are exactly TWO conventions, and they follow the
    dimensionality of the solve:

      data type   power stored             log unit   sqrt(power)/|amp|
      ------------------------------------------------------------------
      2-D         sigma_2d = |A|^2/(4k)    dBke       1/(2 sqrt(k))  <- per freq
      3-D         sigma    = 4 pi |F|^2    dBsm       sqrt(4 pi) = 3.5449

    (2-D "RCS" is a scattering WIDTH in metres, so the length comes from 1/k --
    which is why that factor moves with frequency; 3-D is a cross-section in m^2
    and the 4 pi is the isotropic reference in the definition of sigma.)

    A delta is a 2-D data type -- not a third one.  ``rcs_domain='delta'`` is an
    ORTHOGONAL axis saying the samples are a difference (featured - clean); the
    pipeline routes on it, and it does not change the units.

So anything RcsGrid does in the POWER domain (dBsm/dBke, crop, mirror, join,
statistics, plotting) is correct on these files as-is.  But ``RcsGrid.rcs`` --
which it rebuilds as sqrt(power) * exp(j*phase) -- is a scaled field: fine to add
or subtract WITHIN one export type (the constant cancels), wrong if you mix a 3-D
export with a 2-D delta.  ``field_amplitude()`` below removes the factor and
gives back this repo's amplitude.

Also note RcsGrid derives power from its own complex samples, so a grid it BUILT
satisfies power == |rcs|^2; the table above is about grids it LOADED from here.

What this module is for:
  * ``to_grid`` / ``from_grid``     -- hand a file to that tool and get it back
                                      without losing the complex amplitude
  * ``field_amplitude``            -- RcsGrid samples -> this repo's amplitude
  * ``load_pattern_any``           -- read the formats RcsGrid can import
                                      (.out, .ss, PIO, theta/phi CSV or TXT) into
                                      the dict ``point_scatterer_amplitude``
                                      wants, so an external 3-D MoM result does
                                      not have to be hand-built into a .grim
  * ``describe``                   -- print what a .grim is, in both tools' terms

The other repo is found via $GRIM_REVISED_PATH, else a sibling directory named
GRIM_Revised_2.  Everything here degrades to a clear error if it is absent; the
rest of this repo never imports it.

    There are only TWO conventions, read off the file's own tag -- not measured:

      rcs_linear_quantity == 'sigma_2d'   sigma_2d = |amp|^2/(4k)  -> 1/(2 sqrt(k))

    The pattern must still follow the placement CONVENTION documented on
    point_scatterer_amplitude: az/el are the CAVITY-frame spherical angles with
    +z the aperture normal, VV = theta-pol and HH = phi-pol about that normal,
    the phase origin is the cavity location, and the samples are the DIFFERENCE

    the external solver/export setup.  Untagged patterns are refused by the
    placement code rather than silently assuming an origin or time sign.

    An external file gives power (+ phase where it has it), so the complex
    samples come out as sqrt(power) * exp(j*phase) -- the 3-D field amplitude up
    to sqrt(4 pi), which is what a sigma-valued pattern means.  Files with no
